.Goals
[abstract]
If you are a Java developer, and want to use a plain Java object graph mapper, then this guide introduces the Neo4j-OGM library.
While this guide is not comprehensive, it will introduce the different APIs and link to the relevant resources.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with the link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
Having link:/download[installed Neo4j] and tried out our link:/developer/cypher[Cypher Query language] helps too.
When developing with Neo4j, please use JDK 8 and your favorite IDE.

=== icon:check-circle-o[] Neo4j-OGM 

While using the Cypher query language directly works well for small projects and more advanced queries, the boilerplate of CRUD operations gets tedious.

That's where object graph mappers come in.
They take your existing domain objects (POJOs) and map them to Neo4j.
With a graph database that's easier than with a relational database as there is no such data-model mismatch.

Besides the Neo4j-OGM introduced here, there are also link:../spring-data-neo4j[Spring Data Neo4j], link:../java#hibernate[Hibernate-OGM] and others.

We created the Neo4j-OGM as a standalone object graph mapper for Java as a base library for Spring Data Neo4j.

The Neo4j-OGM uses Cypher consistently under the hood and supports several transport protocols - bolt, http and embedded.
That's why besides either the neo4j-java-driver, http-client or Neo4j itself it has no special dependencies.

=== Features

The Neo4j-OGM supports the features you would expect:

* Object graph mapping of annotated node- and relationship-entities
* Neo4jSession for direct interaction with Neo4j
* Fast class metadata scanning
* Optimized management of data loading and change tracking for minimal data transfers
* Multiple transports: *binary protocol*, HTTP and embedded
* Persistence lifecycle events
* Query result projection to DTOs

=== Minimal Code Snippet

This code example is taken from the Example Project (see below).

// todo replace with actual include

[source,java]
----
@NodeEntity(label="Film")
public class Movie {

   @GraphId Long id;

   @Property(name="title")
   private String name;
}

@NodeEntity
public class Actor extends DomainObject {

   @GraphId
   private Long id;

   @Property(name="name")
   private String fullName;

   @Relationship(type="ACTED_IN", direction=Relationship.OUTGOING)
   private List<Role> filmography;

}

@RelationshipEntity(type="ACTED_IN")
public class Role {
    @GraphId   private Long relationshipId;
    @Property  private String title;
    @StartNode private Actor actor;
    @EndNode   private Movie movie;
