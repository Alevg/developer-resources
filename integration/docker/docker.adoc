.Goals
[abstract]
Running Neo4j with Docker is supported officially, both by Neo Technology and Docker.
There is an official Docker image for Neo4j as well as more specific images provided by us.
Detailed instructions are available at the linked repositories, which we don't want to duplicate here.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should have a sound understanding of both Docker and Neo4j, to leverage them effectively together.

== General Observations

http://docker.com[Docker] is a lightweight virtualization mechanism to run single applications containerized and restricted on a Linux host system.
Docker images are pre-built from dependent layers that build up the minimal setup required by the application or service to be run.
Each layer is built from a simple text file (`Dockerfile`) that describes the operations to add the necessary filesystem-content on that layer.
A docker image can be started immediately after downloading, in a few seconds.
You can run as many docker image instances on your host as your resources allow, they are isolated from each other.

There are several ways to leverage Docker for your Neo4j deployment.

You can create throw-away Neo4j instances of many different versions for testing and running your applications.
You can pre-seed containers with datasets, extensions and configurations.

Conflicting port and disk usage can be handled by mapping ports and volumes of multiple instances of the same container to different on the host system.
Docker containers can be used as infrastructure layer, data containers or configuration providers.

== The official Neo4j Docker Image

Starting from Neo4j 2.3 we are happy to release official https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j/[Neo4j Docker images], both for Neo4j Community as well as Enterprise Edition.

It is offically supported both by Docker and Neo Technology.
New versions will be made available with new Neo4j releases.
Previous versions and milestones are available as tags in of the https://hub.docker.com/r/neo4j/neo4j/tags/[neo4j/neo4j] image.

The Dockerfiles for the different versions are taken from https://github.com/neo4j/docker-neo4j/[this GitHub repository] and synched with Docker Hub and the official repository as needed.

== How to use the Neo4j Docker Image

[NOTE]
For running Docker on https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/[Max OSX] and https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/[Windows] please consult the Docker documentation.

== Capabilities

The Neo4j Docker image comes with these capabilities:

* configure memory usage
* configure passwords or disable auth
* configure file-descriptor limits and logical log retention
* setup server extensions

The Enterprise Edition additionally provides:

* run an high-availability cluster
* access online-backup
* advanced monitoring

*Please read the https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j/[information on Docker-Hub] for detailed and latest documentation on features, configuration, cluster-setup and environment variables.*

Enjoy using the Docker Image and please provide us feedback, via https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/docker-neo4j/issues[GitHub issues], http://twitter.com/neo4j[Twitter] or by mailto:feedback@neotechnology.com[dropping us an email].

The Neo4j Docker image is for example used in our http://neo4j.com/sandbox[live Neo4j Sandbox] offering and the http://neo4j.com/blog/graph-your-network-neo4j-docker-image/[Graph your Twitter Network Demo].
