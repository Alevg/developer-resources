=== Neo4j for JavaScript Developers

Neo4j can be installed on any system and then accessed via its binary and HTTP APIs. 

You can use the official binary driver for JavaScript (neo4j-driver) or connect via HTTP using the `request` module or any of our community drivers.

=== icon:check-circle-o[] Neo4j Javascript Driver

include::../_includes/javascript-driver.adoc[]

include::../_includes/sample_project.adoc[]

include::../_includes/community-driver-notice.adoc[]

There is a nice, more detailed intro article on modulus on http://blog.modulus.io/learn-how-to-use-neo4j-with-node.js[how to use Neo4j from Javascript].


[[node-neo4j]]
=== node-neo4j (Thingdom)

Most widely used Node.js driver for Neo4j.
This driver aims to be the most robust, comprehensive, and battle-tested community driver available. 
It's run in production by https://www.fiftythree.com/[FiftyThree] to power https://www.fiftythree.com/paper[Paper] and https://mix.fiftythree.com/[Mix].


==== Features

* Cypher queries, parameters, batching, and transactions
* Arbitrary HTTP requests, for custom Neo4j plugins
* Custom headers, for high availability, application tracing, query logging, and more
* Precise errors, for robust error handling from the start
* Configurable connection pooling, for performance tuning & monitoring
* Thorough test coverage with >100 tests
* Continuously integrated against multiple versions of Node.js and Neo4j

=== cypher-stream

Neo4j cypher queries as node object streams.

Transactions are duplex streams that allow you to write query statements then commit or roll back the written queries.

To get a stream per statement, just pass a callback function with the statement object. 
This works for regular cypher calls and transactions.

=== Seraph

*Seraph* is a comprehensive, well documented driver for Neo4j, which supports all Neo4j features and provides not only Neo4j connection support, but extensive lifecycle handling.
The additional extensions *seraph-model* and *seraph-resource* allow you to quickly load and persist your models and integrate seraph-model resolution into your express routes with a base-controller for CRUD operations.
With *disposable-seraph* you can manage a disposable Neo4j-instance for automatic testing.

=== simple-neo4j

This is a simple neo4j pure javascript database driver. 
It takes in one or more queries, commits them to the database in a single transaction, and parses the database result into a simple and easy native javascript object, of course the parser can be disabled if desired.


[source, javascript]
----
simpleNeo4J.execute('MATCH (n:Movie) RETURN count(*)')
    .then(function(result)
    {
        result.firstValue === 26;
    });

=== Meteor.js - Package ccorcos:neo4j

image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Meteor-logo.png[width=200]
http://meteor.com[Meteor] is a complete open source platform for building web and mobile apps in pure JavaScript.

Chet and Sam Corcos created the `ccorcos:neo4j` package that integrates Meteor well with Neo4j including reactivity and query-reevaluation on data changes.

Both wrote and presented about it and Chet provided insight into an example application for event feeds, written with Meteor and Neo4j as a stack.

=== Neo4j Dart

image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/35/Dart_logo_wordmark.png[width=200]

A Neo4j driver for Dart. Both a simple driver and an OGM (Object Graph Mapper) is provided in separate libraries.

////
.Example
[source,dart]
----
import 'package:neo4j_dart/neo4j_dart.dart';

main() async {
  var db = new Neo4j();
  var result = await db.cypher('''
        Create (dart:Language {dart})-[:connects_to]->(neo4j:Database {neo4j})
        Return id(dart), id(neo4j)
      ''', {
        'dart': { 'name': 'Dart' },
        'neo4j': { 'name': 'Neo4j' },
      });

  print('successfully created two nodes with id ${result['data'][0]['row'].join(' and ')}');
}

=== neo4j-js

A Node.js (pure JavaScript) client library for accessing neo4j databases with batch support.

* http://github.com/bretcope/neo4j-js[neo4j-js on GitHub]
* Author: Bret Copeland

=== node-neo4j-embedded

Node.js driver for the embedded Neo4j Database, it accesses the datatabase API through the JVM-integration directly.
Also supports HA Setups.

Note: This is not idiomatic Javascript.
For performance reasons it stays as close to the original Java API as possible.

=== Using the HTTP-Endpoint directly

You can use something as simple as the `request` node-module to send queries to and receive responses from Neo4j.
The endpoint protocol and formats are explained in detail in the {manual}/http-api/#http-api-transactional[Neo4j Manual].
It enables you do to much more, e.g. sending many statements per request or keeping transactions open across multiple requests.

Here is a very simple example:

.Simple Function Accessing the Remote Endpoint
[source, javascript]
----
var r=require("request");
var txUrl = "http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit";
function cypher(query,params,cb) { 
  r.post({uri:txUrl,
          json:{statements:[{statement:query,parameters:params}]}},
         function(err,res) { cb(err,res.body)}) 
}
----

.Running the Function
[source, javascript]
---- 
var query="MATCH (n:User) RETURN n, labels(n) as l LIMIT {limit}"
var params={limit: 10}
var cb=function(err,data) { console.log(JSON.stringify(data)) }
 
cypher(query,params,cb)
 
{"results":[
  {"columns":["n","l"],
   "data":[
     {"row":[{"name":"Aran"},["User"]]}
    ]
  }],
 "errors":[]}
