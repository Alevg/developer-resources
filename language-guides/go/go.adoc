.Goals
[abstract]
If you are a Go developer, this guide provides an overview of options for connecting to Neo4j.
While this guide is not comprehensive it will introduce the different drivers and link to the relevant resources.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher[Cypher Query language].

=== Neo4j for Go Developers

image::{img}GO.jpg[width=150,float=right]

Go drivers have been around for a while and, especially with the excellent `cq` driver from Eve Freeman, have gotten a lot of attention.
Recently the work of John Nadratowski added a driver with Bolt support.
// end::intro[]

Members of the Go community have invested a lot of time and love to develop all these drivers, so if you use them, *please provide feedback to the authors*.

=== Golang Neo4J Bolt Driver

This implementation attempts to follow the best practices as per the Bolt specification, but also implements compatibility with Golang's `sql.driver` interface.

It is recommended that you use the Neo4j Bolt-specific interfaces if possible.
The implementation is more efficient and can more closely support the Neo4j Bolt feature set.

Features

* Neo4j Bolt low-level binary protocol support
* Message Pipelining for high concurrency
* Connection Pooling
* TLS support
* Compatible with sql.driver

=== CQ

A database/sql implementation for Cypher inspired by the http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/[database/sql] package which provides idiomatic go database access.
Cypher is close enough to SQL that it seems to fit pretty well in the database/sql implementation.

=== Neoism

Neoism is a Go client library providing access to the Neo4j graph database via its HTTP REST API.
This driver is fairly complete, and is suitable for general use.
The code has an extensive set of integration tests.
