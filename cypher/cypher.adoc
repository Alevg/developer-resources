Cypher is Neo4j's open graph query language.
Cypher's syntax provides a familiar way to match patterns of nodes and relationships in the graph.

These developer guides and tutorials show you how to query Neo4j using Cypher.

Here is a simple example of a Cypher query (cast of movies starting with "T")

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie)
WHERE movie.title STARTS WITH "T"
RETURN movie.title AS title, collect(actor.name) AS cast
ORDER BY title ASC LIMIT 10;
----

If you're be able to read and understand it without any training, we achieved our goal.


[[intro]]
== Introduction to Cypher

These guides explain the basic concepts of Cypher, including how to create and query data.
You should be able to read, understand and write Cypher queries after completing them.

[TIP]
In Neo4j Cypher statements are executed via a *fast binary protocol*, using our link:/developer/language-guides#bolt-drivers[officially supported drivers].
A *cost based optimizer* uses real-time database statistics to run your statements as efficiently as possible.
You can always access the underlying query-plans using the `EXPLAIN` and `PROFILE` prefixes.

== The openCypher Project

Since October 2015 the link:http://openCypher.org[openCypher] project aims to provide an open grammar, language specification, technical compatibility kit and reference implementation of parser, planner and runtime for Cypher.

It is backed by several companies in the database space and allows implementors of databases and clients to freely benefit, use from and contribute to the development of the openCypher language.


[[recommendation]]
== Build a Recommendation Engine

This guide explains how to leverage connections in your data to gather insights and start recommending currently unrelated but relevant facts to your nodes in focus.

[[procedures-functions]]
== Extending Cypher with User Defined Procedures and Functions

Cypher is a quite powerful and expressive language, with first class graph pattern and collection support.

But sometimes you need to do more than it currently offers, like additional graph algorithms, parallization or custom conversions.

That's why the ability to extend Cypher with link:procedures-functions[User Defined Procedures and Functions] was added to the Neo4j 3.0 and 3.1 releases.
Learn how to use, create and deploy procedures and functions to take your graph capabilities to the next level.


== Cypher Reference Card

The link:/docs/cypher-refcard/[*Cypher Reference Card*] is an invaluable resource for each Neo4j user.
It details every clause, function and keyword in Cypher with short examples to help you understand the concepts.
You should keep a link:/docs/pdf/neo4j-cypher-refcard-stable.pdf[printed variant] handy at all times.
